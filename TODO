boss modules:
- dsw2
-- p2 sanctity 2: aoes during second set of towers
-- p3 drachenlance 2 and later
- generalize components as much as possible
- fail log
- wipe should not fast forward all phases
- p3s - review, searing breeze component
- aglaia revise, implement phases
- boss module config presets/profiles

ai:
- improve healing AI: analyze incoming dps
- movement: know time left, distance to travel => decide whether to swiftcast or slidecast or use movement rotation

autorotation:
- dot/regen server tick tracking
- war
-- simulate gauge changes (message can arrive few frames after ActionEffect...)
-- low-level rotation - improve berserk delay logic
-- gauge & buff visualization
- whm:
-- 6.1 adjustments
-- planner
-- smart-targeting for ST actions

cooldown planner:
- in-combat cooldown plan ui
- select columns to show (concrete actions, categories)
- plan tankswaps
- plan raid cooldowns (think about ui and storage for that...)
- show hp, statuses, ...

world rendering:
- danger zones (modify action vfx?)
- arrows

replay encounter analysis:
- tether & debuff passing range
- pull range

network:
- hook send/recv (a-la xivalexander)
- store raw packets, create visualizer
- auto detect new opcodes for known packets based on size
- allow injecting custom client messages in next sent bundle (or just create new bundle?..)

misc:
- memory show/watch utility
- clip circles to arena bounds...
- draw target max-melee and boss positioning hints?..
- assignments/config sharing (webservice?)
- ?? aoe checks should take hitbox into account (0.5 for players) - cones, circles, rects... - apparently not really...

notes on targeting:
- aoe (e.g. cone) will hit if shape intersects target's hitbox; for players it is == 0.5
- max melee range is raw range (usually 3) + source hitbox radius + target hitbox radius; for players this usually means 3.5 + target hitbox
- charge/onslaught will bring player to source hitbox radius + target hitbox radius range, or leave in place if current distance is less
