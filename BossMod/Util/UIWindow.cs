    // - show/hide state is decoupled from lifetime (window can be closed by ui interaction, then reopened again later)
    // - expected to have globally unique name (violating this throws an exception)

    // - initially opened, closing automatically disposes it
    // - if another window with same name already exists, it is opened and focused instead; this can be detected by IsOpen being false after base class constructor runs
